# 🚌 Bus Reservation System (C Language)

A simple terminal-based bus reservation system written in C.

This project allows users to:

- 🔐 Register and log in
- 🪑 View available seats (1 bus with fixed seats)
- 🧾 Book a seat and enter passenger details
- ❌ Cancel a booking
- 📄 View all bookings

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🐧 On Linux/macOS:
```bash
gcc bus_reservation.c -o bus_reservation
./bus_reservation
````

### 🪟 On Windows (using MinGW or GCC):

```bash
gcc bus_reservation.c -o bus_reservation.exe
bus_reservation.exe
```

> 💡 Make sure required `.txt` files (like `users.txt`, `bookings.txt`, `seatList.txt`) are in the same folder as the executable.
